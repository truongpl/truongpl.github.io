## AI exercises

In the last few months, I have applied for various AI/ML positions, both at startups and IT outsourcing companies. Most of these positions required a take-home test, which took me about 3-5 days to complete. Out of these tests, I encountered two that were particularly interesting as they covered different aspects of ML, and fortunately, I successfully passed both of them. Below, I'll share my solutions and insights: 

### Home test 1
This take home test requires 3-5 days to tackle the problem. The dataset is the the [SEED](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phhasian0710/seed-iv?resource=download) dataset.

### Home test 2
This take home test requires two weeks to tackle the problem. The dataset is the the [Microsoft Azure Predictive Maintenance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabbiswas1/microsoft-azure-predictive-maintenance) dataset.


### Solutions
I use this repository [Solutions](https://github.com/truongpl/hometest). to share my practical ML work and solutions. If you find it helpful, please consider giving it a star ðŸŒŸ. Thank you! ðŸ˜Š
